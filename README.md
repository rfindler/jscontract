# JSCONTRACT

## Getting Started

You will need to have `node` version 14+, `npm` version 7+, and `git` installed onto your computer. From there, clone this repository and run:

```sh
npm install
```

From there, you can run the tool by doing:

```sh
./workspaces/type-explorer/bin/ct $PACKAGE_NAME
```

Where `$PACKAGE_NAME` is the name of a JavaScript package that you would like to test.
