  - Attempted to run every package on DefinitelyTyped through the Compiler. VPS ran out of disk space
  - base-64 - Untyped JavaScript is much more lax (accepts null and undefined)
  - urlparser - Untyped JavaScript doesn't put all the keys on the field
  - audiosprite - TypeError: Wrong argument count 3/2; issue with Contracts or compiler?
  - abs - All tests pass!
  - classify-poetry - All tests pass!
  - Thoughts:
    - Readonly array?
    - Promises?
    - Finding errors automatically?
