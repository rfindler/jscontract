  - Attempted to run every package on DefinitelyTyped through the Compiler. VPS ran out of disk space
  - base-64 - Untyped JavaScript is much more lax (accepts null and undefined)
  - urlparser - Untyped JavaScript doesn't put all the keys on the field
  - audiosprite - TypeError: Wrong argument count 3/2; issue with Contracts or compiler?
  - abs - All tests pass!
  - classify-poetry - All tests pass!
  - Thoughts:
    - Readonly array?
    - Promises?
    - Finding errors automatically?

  - Added garbage collection to script; we now delete the code after the fact.
  - Packages with potential issues:
    - blocked-at
    - checksum
    - coffeeify
    - colornames
    - commondir
    - config
    - contains-path
    - cssbeautify
    - cwd
    - dashify
    - deasync
    - defaults-deep
    - ellipsize
    - event-loop-lag
    - events
    - falafel
    - field
    - filesize-parser
    - find-exec
    - form-urlencoded
    - git-diff
    - git-url-parse
    - git-user-email
    - git-username
    - github-url-to-object
    - global-modules-path
    - graygelf
    - group-array
    - gtmetrix
    - hex-rgba
    - hex2dec
    - hh-mm-ss
    - html-truncate
  - Themes:
    - TypeScript and JavaScript have different semantics
      - See `filesize-parser`; has the same problem as base-64 (the JavaScript tests for wacky inputs; the TypeScript types dissallow them)
    - Not all test failures are problems!
      - Example: `dashify` test fails because the _error message_ is different
        - Same with several other packages in the list
        - Automatically detects defensive programming
    - Function arity
      - See `global-modules-path`; some of the tests feed too many arguments into the functions. JavaScript ignores, TypeScript prevents; is that a problem?
  - Potential next steps:
    - Add statistics gathering to the script?
      - For each package, report:
        - Can we download it successfully?
        - Can we compile the index.d.ts file into contracts?
        - Can we run the tests using the contracts?
        - Do the tests succeed?
          - Can see roughly how to add, but not sure whether we want to improve the contract library work.
    - Can we add a readonly array contract (e.g., enforce "This array is only meant to be read to")?
    - Promise contracts? (Challenging for reasons listed)
    - Generating code to play with the contracts?
    - Can we do class contracts?

- Adds sorting and filtering; at "G" in the alphabet, reduced the possible set of candidates from ~2000 to ~400
  - Whittle those down to start making meaningful improvements to the compiler by sorting by type length
- Adds priority script - whittles down to specific places to start improving the compiler
- How do we compile:
  - Generic contracts?
  - ArrayLike contracts?
  - Promise contracts?
  - Class contracts?
  - How do we handle when the type definitions don't export some of the features in the module being tested?
